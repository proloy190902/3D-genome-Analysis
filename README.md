# 📌 Overview

HiC-MAFormer is a novel multi-modal transformer-based architecture designed for Hi-C contact map super-resolution. The model takes low-resolution Hi-C matrices (40×40) as input and predicts corresponding high-resolution contact maps, effectively enhancing genomic interaction patterns while preserving biological structure.

This repository currently contains Proposal / Implementation – Phase 1.
